            <h4>Career</h4>
            <p>
                Post Malone's musical career began like most artists: taking risks. The singer was sure that his future was in music, so when he left the institute decided to go to pursue his dream. He left Texas with his lifelong friend, Jason Stokes, and they moved to Los Angeles, California. Being in the city of stars, it was only a matter of time before his great opportunity arrived.

The first months in the city helped him to adapt to his new life. And that moment through a friend in common met the famous producer duo FKi, formed by 1st and Raye Rich. Soon they began to make music.

The first successful collaboration between the artists was"White Iverson,"a subject that refers - in part - to professional basketball player Allen Iverson. As the artist later confessed, the song wrote it two days before recording it.
